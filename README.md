# Voice-Activated-Assistant-with-Speech-Recognition

This Python script showcases the implementation of a voice-activated assistant utilizing speech recognition. With the SpeechRecognition library and the power of Google's speech-to-text capabilities, the assistant listens for commands spoken through a microphone. The assistant, referred to as "Alexa," responds to a range of commands, including playing songs on YouTube using PyWhatKit, providing the current time, offering brief Wikipedia summaries about individuals, sharing jokes, and engaging in casual conversation. The script integrates text-to-speech functionality through the pyttsx3 library, allowing Alexa to audibly respond to the user's queries and commands. The versatility of this voice-activated assistant highlights the potential for creating interactive and hands-free applications, demonstrating the seamless integration of speech recognition and natural language processing in Python.
